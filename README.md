# Shopping List is an application where a group of users can share a common shopping list.  Users can
# add, hide, or remove items from the shopping list.  When the shopper is ready to go, the list is
# up-to-date and ready to go with them.

# The final application would eventually be converted to work on an iPhone or Android.
